<p>I am a freelance writer, editor, marketing professional and comedian from Sydney, Australia now based put of New York City. With a B.A in Communications and Media majoring in Journalism from the University of Notre Dame Australia, I've developed a passion for the written word. After a short stint working in tech for a social media startup, I learned just how under-represented women are in the industry. I was motivated to learn to program by my former colleagues and became obsessed with the challenge. </p>
