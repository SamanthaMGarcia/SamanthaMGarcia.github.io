It has taken a week but I am finally finished (I hope) with my first portfolio project, the CLI Data Gem Project. I procrastinated quite a bit with starting it and along the way, faced a few roadblocks. Before enrolling in Flatiron School's online full stack web development course, I already had some trips away booked; trips I knew would affect my momentum of study. Atop of what this project taught me in regards to building my own app, I also learned a lot about the importance of learning at my own pace and being realistic with my expectations. 

Before getting stuck into the assessment, I did a lot of behind the scenes work. Mainly attending study groups and watching video walkthroughs. The walkthroughs particularly put my mind at ease somewhat since before beginning the assessment, I was convinced I was in way over my head. I felt like I had been cross-country skiing through the curriculum, dodging the obsticles with varying degrees of success, only to reach the edge of the slope, expected to jump. I was at full velocity before starting this project, now one week in, I am at '0 lessons this week' and '0 days learning streak'. Seeing the numbers of lessons drop and the streak go from 28 days to 0, forced me to adjust my mindset about this course. I was at full throttle for as long as I could be. I realize now that up until this point, I was working to pass the lessons, not working towards learning how to code.

I went back over past lessons, as I often do throughout the curriculum, in order to ensure I fully understood the past concepts that would need to be reintroduced in this new challenge. I decided I wanted to scrape the website for acquiring show tickets, TodayTix, and have an interface that would allow a user to read more about the featured shows simply by inputting the number to the corresponding show, from 1-9. As simple as it seemed, my first finished draft of the app was full of code and redundancy. After some time with tech coaches, I was able to refactor the code with iteration. The finished product was so gorgeous I could have cried. So clean. So concise. And strangely enough, so simple.

Scraping I found to be quite satisfying, albeit tedious. What I found most difficult actually was setting up my environment, something that I hadn't done before nor seen in previous lessons. My first 1:1 call for this project was purely on setting up my environment just because I wasn't sure if I was doing it correctly, as I had always been in the comfort of the Learn IDE's already established directory. It turned out that setting up the environment wasn't tough in itself, but rather what was tough was getting over the mental barrier that I was working without a test suite, and building the confidence to go it alone without the Ask a Question feature. 

I have thoroughly enjoyed doing this project and am quietly proud of what I have achieved so far. My confidence has been broken and rebuilt over this week, much like my code; and just like my project now, it is better for it.
