I have just finished my final  portfolio project and it was hands-down the hardest one yet. Not even convinced I knew JavaScript all that well, I was thrown into React feeling like I was learning a whole new language. Granted coming out of my assessment review with Howard gave me a lot of confidence to tackle the final section of this course, my need to understand the content was rivalled by a greater need to finish the course before December 31st (for financial reasons).

# Rails
Once again I was reminded of how much I love Ruby and how easy it is to understand. Writing out CRUD functions and using Rails generators felt like second nature to me and is certainly my strongest skill obtained from this course. I was able to write out the Rails API very quickly and was not at all deterred by the fact that I was once again starting a project from scratch rather than being able to clone and expand upon work I had already done.

# React
React has been hard to grasp. Understanding components and props is only now getting easier after having completed this project. The same goes with reading JSX. Given its similarities with JS, I am reminded of how easily I can mix up my learnings. Using React DevTools helped me see the backend of the code I was creating just as DevTools in the previous assessment helped me watch requests fire and see response time. A facet of coding I have learned interests me very little but is in fact quite important in web development, only further re-enforcing my desire to finish and not pursue a career in web development but rather product management.

# Redux 
Once again not confident I understood React, I moved into the Redux portion of the curriculum with much apprehension and fear; which was masked by an excitement to finish. Readings online spoke very passionately of how Redux wasn't as necessary and useful as it has been; somewhat how I felt and what I had read about Sinatra. Alas, I worked through the curriculum (read, struggled) and watched as many videos as possible in order to understand how this data management system could effectively be implemented on my app.

My app is a very simple wine store (no guesses what I had on my mind when starting the project). Just like how I approached the previous assessment, I did the bare minimum needed to fulfill the assessment requirements. I would say my biggest struggle with this assignment was connecting my API with the client side. Doing so took a lot of time to research followed by a lot of trial and error. 

I am proud that I have done this course and finished. I am so lucky to have had the incredible support of my Flatiron School family. But I am excited to pursue a career in product management that requires little to no code-writing. I will however never stop reading about and practising code but doing so in an examniable way is certainly not something I wish to endure again. I am fortunate I have had this experience and I am thrilled I can now call myself Flatiron School alum!
